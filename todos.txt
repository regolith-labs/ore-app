BoostDeposit (Idle) -> @use_pair_deposit_transaction.rs in @pair_deposit_form.rs 

BoostWithdraw (Idle) -> @use_pair_withdraw_transaction.rs in @pair_withdraw_form.rs in 

BoostClaim (Pass to both)-> @use_boost_claim_transaction.rs vs @use_boost_claim_all_transaction.rs ? in @stake.rs

PoolClaim -> ? @use_miner_claim_transaction.rs in @mine.rs -> MinerData

PoolJoin -> @use_pool_register_transaction.rs in @mine.rs -> StartStopButton

== Pending ==
Swap (done)
BoostDeposit,
BoostWithdraw,
BoostClaim,
PoolClaim,
PoolJoin,

Remove logs

== Notes ==
Add an endpoint into the API to log transaction signatures with a transaction type.
Log the transaction signature and type into a database.
Create a background job to periodically look up transaction statuses and add this data to our database.
Export this data to a warehouse where it can be queried for business insights.
We want to be able to breakdown app activity and revenue by feature and by user.
In submit_transaction, send the transaction signature and type to our API.
